# Dungeon1.py
Code for Instructable project about RPG
There is no license on this project, you can copy, alter, pplay with .... as much as you like. 
This is my first real program using Python 3, there are probably a lot of things I could have done better, 
and I intend to improve it using Qty or PyPDF2 (here on GitHub) or Python-docx but I simply did not have the time to
learn any of these before the end of the contest.
If you find it useful, see any error or improve it, please write to me, I'll be grateful and curious !
